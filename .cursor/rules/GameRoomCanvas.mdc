# GameRoomCanvas Component Guide

The `GameRoomCanvas` component is responsible for rendering the game room using PixiJS. It initializes a PixiJS `Application` and manages the rendering of miners and the game grid.

Key Elements:
- **Initialization**: The component initializes a PixiJS `Application` and appends the canvas to the DOM.
- **Rendering**: It uses containers to manage the grid and sprites for miners.
- **Interaction**: Handles user interactions with the grid and updates the state accordingly.

For more details, see the [GameRoomCanvas.tsx](mdc:components/GameRoomCanvas.tsx) file.
